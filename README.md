NomadMap is an open source platform for managing a digital nomad life, alone or with a team.




#What is NomadMap?
NomadMap is a platform that allows digital nomads of any proffesion to clearly communicate their past, current and future plans. NomadMap is here to make the digital nomad life simple and safe - and to ease employers / clients worries about hiring a digital nomad. 

Our features are aimed at ensuring nomads can clearly communicate what they are doing at all times, sharing their locations and travel plans, current tasks, contact details etc. We also want to allow our nomads to share information across teams and search their local area for nomads who are in the area for job opportunities.
